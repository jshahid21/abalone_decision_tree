# Abalone Age Prediction using Decision Tree Regression

This project explores the use of a Decision Tree Regressor to predict the age of abalone based on physical measurements.

## Model Performance

The Decision Tree Regressor achieved an accuracy score of approximately **20.2%** on the test set.

## Interpretation of Accuracy Score

An accuracy score of 20.2% is very low for this regression task. This suggests that the model is not performing well in predicting the number of rings (age) of the abalone. There could be several reasons for this:

*   **Data complexity**: The relationship between the physical measurements and the number of rings might be more complex than a single decision tree can effectively capture.
*   **Feature limitations**: The chosen features might not be sufficiently predictive of the abalone's age.
*   **Model limitations**: Decision Tree Regressors can be prone to overfitting, especially on datasets with a wide range of target values like this one.

## Next Steps

Further steps could involve:

*   Exploring the data distribution and relationships between features and the target variable.
*   Trying different regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression).
*   Performing feature engineering to create new features that might be more predictive.
*   Hyperparameter tuning of the Decision Tree Regressor or other chosen models.
